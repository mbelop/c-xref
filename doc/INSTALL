IMPORTANT NOTICE: C-xrefactory is the new name for Xrefactory versions
1.*. Renaming of Xrefactory to C-xrefactory allows coexistance of both
softwares  under different  license  conditions.  If  anywhere in  the
documentation, you see a (forgotten) reference to xref, or xrefactory,
it probably refers to c-xref and c-xrefactory.

In order to install C-Xrefactory on your machine just type:

    sh ./c-xrefsetup

This script will guide you  through the installation of C-Xrefactory and
will introduce its main functions.

If  you  like C-Xrefactory  and  you  are  super-user, you  can  install
C-Xrefactory  into  system  directories  by running  'sh  ./c-xrefinstall'
script.  This  will make  C-Xrefactory available for  all users  on this
machine.   However,  this  script  does  not  guide  you  through  the
C-Xrefactory features.

In following text C-XREFDIR denotes the directory where you have untared
the  C-Xrefactory  distribution (it  is  not  an environment  variable).
Substitute this  directory for C-XREFDIR  in the following text  and put
lines:

	(setq exec-path (cons "C-XREFDIR" exec-path))
	(setq load-path (cons "C-XREFDIR/emacs" load-path))
	(load "c-xrefactory")

  to your ~/.emacs file.

It  is  done. It  is  highly recommended  that  you  work through  the
tutorials  starting by  'C-XREFDIR/cexercise/index.c'.   To start  the
tutorial just open the file and follow the instructions written there.

C-Xrefactory uses  F3-F8 functional hot-keys.  It  is highly recommended
that you keep this binding during the tutorials and initial evaluation
of C-Xrefactory.  Later, you can redefine key bindings either by editing
c-xrefactory.el file or by adding the line:

    (defvar c-xref-key-binding 'none)

to your  .emacs file  BEFORE loading of  "c-xrefactory" file.  This line
prevents C-Xrefactory  from binding its  functions to hot  keys allowing
you to define your own keys.
